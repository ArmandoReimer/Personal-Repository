<br><h1>The help text pseudo object</h1> <br clear="left"><br><br>
        This pseudo object can be thought of as a super text object ... i.e. a collection
        of text objects that can be created and deleted with a single command. The pseudo
        object is created with either on of the following two commands:<br><br>
        <span class="mcode">plt('HelpText','set',v);</span><br>
        <span class="mcode">plt('HelpText','on',v);</span><br><br>where <span class="mcode">v</span>
        is a string or more commonly a cell array of strings and string properties. The HelpText
        object is associated with the current figure window. Unlike the other pseudo objects, a
        figure may contain only one HelpText object, which is why an object handle is not returned.
        If you create a new HelpText object for a figure that already has one, the old one is simply
        deleted before the new one is created.
        <br><br>
        The second form above ('on') is equivalent to the following two commands:<br>
        <span class="mcode">plt('HelpText','set',v);</span><br>
        <span class="mcode">plt('HelpText','on');</span><br>
        where the 'on' command is described below. Thus the two initialization forms are similar
        except that when the first form is used the text will not become visible until the first
        'on' command is issued, whereas with the second form, the text becomes visible immediately.
        <br><br>
        As mentioned in the
        <nobr><a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Labels%20and%20figure%20properties.htm">Labels and figure properties</a></nobr>
        section you may also create a HelpText pseudo object at the same time the plt pseudo object is created
        by including <span class="mcode">'HelpText',v</span> in the parameter list of the call
        to plt. (In fact, that is by far the most common way this pseudo object is created.)
        Creating the HelpText that way is similar to the 'on' command above in that the help text
        becomes visible right away (i.e. a separate HelpText 'on' command is not needed).
        <br><br>
        The structure of the <span class="mcode">v</span> parameter is described in the table at the
        bottom of this page, but first I'll list the commands used to control the HelpText object.
        The functional form may be used but the command form is shown below since that is more
        convenient when only string arguments are needed:<br><br>
        <table border="3" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" vspace="12" hspace="20" bordercolor="#9999ff">
        <tr><td width="220"><span class="mcode">plt HelpText on</span></td>
            <td>Although the pseudo object is created with the above <span class="mcode">'set'</span>
                command, the individual text objects defined are not actually created until this
                <span class="mcode">on</span> command is given. Most often this command is used to
                reenable the Help Text after it was turned off with the command shown below.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><span class="mcode">plt HelpText<br>plt&nbsp;HelpText&nbsp;off</span></td>
            <td>Both of these forms are equivalent. They delete the text objects created by the above
                <span class="mcode">on</span> command. Often you will want the help text to disappear
                once the user starts using the plot so it doesn't get in the way. One way to do this
                is to include <span class="mcode">'MoveCB','plt&nbsp;HelpText;'</span> in the parameter
                list when you are creating the plt pseudo object. This sets the move cursor callback
                so that when you move the cursor or click on the plot, the help text will be removed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><span class="mcode">plt('HelpText','get')</span></td>
            <td>This returns the <span class="mcode">v</span> parameter that was used to create the HelpText object. There aren't many uses for this command, although one use would be to
            copy a HelpText object from one figure to another.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><span class="mcode">plt('HelpText','text')</span></td>
            <td>This returns a list of handles to text objects that were created after a helptext
            <span class="mcode">'on'</span> command has been executed. An empty list is returned
            if the helptext object is currently off. Since Helptext is marked with a special user
            value, an equivalent result is returned from the command
            <nobr><span class="mcode">findobj(gcf,'user',355/113);</span></nobr>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        The easiest way to describe the structure of the <span class="mcode">v</span> argument used
        above is by a series of examples:<br>
        <br>
        <table border="3" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" vspace="12" hspace="20" bordercolor="#9999ff">
        <tr><td width="300"><span class="mcode">'abcdef'</span></td>
            <td>Using a single string for the <span class="mcode">v</span> parameter doesn't give
                the resulting HelpText object much utility beyond the underlying text object it creates
                but this is still sometimes useful because it is so easy to create along with the plt pseudo object.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><span class="mcode">{'abcdef' -.1+.5i}</span></td>
            <td>Usually you will use a cell array to define the help text which allows you to specify more parameters
                other than just the string. The only required parameter when using the cell array definition is the
                text object location which is specified by a complex number (the real part giving the horizontal position
                and the imaginary part giving the vertical position). In this example the horizontal position is to the
                left of the main axis (by 10% of the plot) and the vertical position is at the middle of the main plot.
                If the location is not specified (by using a string argument as in the example above) the position used
                is .03+.96i</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><span class="mcode">{'abc'&nbsp;'def'&nbsp;'line3' .5+.96i<br>'color' 703050 'fontsize' 20}</span></td>
            <td>Each text string may be as many lines as you want (3 lines in this example). After the position
                element you may specify as many property value pairs as you need. Only text properties are
                allowed. If the text color is not specified, the default color [1 .6 0] is used. The font size will
                default to 12 if not specified.  Note that for this form (as well as the following one below), the
                position value (complex) is required. This helptext argument must be a row cell array. (A column
                cell array will not produce the expected result.) Note that in this example, the color is defined
                using one of plt's alternate forms (described in the
                <nobr><a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Colors.htm">Colors</a></nobr> section) and the number
                703050 used here could have been replaced with [70&nbsp;30&nbsp;50] or the traditional Matlab
                form [.7&nbsp;.3&nbsp;.5].</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><span class="mcode">{'ab' 'cd' .5+.9i<br>'color' 'red' 2i<br>'line3' .1+.1i 2i<br>'line4' .9+.9i<br>'fontweight' 'bold'}</span></td>
            <td>With the full generality, you may define as many strings as you want, with each of these
                strings being in different locations with different string properties. This example creates
                three strings, the first of which is two lines. The "2i" (which occurs twice) in this example
                is a separator that indicates a new string is about to be defined. Actually any
                complex number will serve the same purpose, but my habit is to always use "2i" for this
                separator to make it easy to recognize.<br><br>
                In this example, the first two help lines ('ab' & 'cd') will be red because the text is followed
                by the color specifier [1 0 0]. However the next two lines ('line3' & 'line4') have no color
                specifier, so they will be in the default color ([1 .6 0]). However if you change the
                <span class="mcode">2i</span> that appears just before <span class="mcode">'line3'</span>
                to a <span class="mcode">-2i</span> then line3 will also be red. This is because a delimiter
                with a negative imaginary component indicates that you want all the properties specified for
                the previous helptext line to apply to the current one as well. If you changed the next
                 <span class="mcode">2i</span> to a  <span class="mcode">-2i</span> as well, then all the help
                lines defined will be red. If the same property is included both after the text string and
                in the carry over property list (enabled by the negative imaginary component) then the
                property value after the text string takes priority.
            </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <br>Many of the demo programs (including afilt, curves, editz, gauss, julia, pltquiv, subplt, tasplt, trigplt, and wfalltst) create a HelpText
        pseudo object, so you can refer to these programs to see practical examples of the use of the HelpText pseudo object.
