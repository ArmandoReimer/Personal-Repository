    <td>The plt pseudo object can be thought of as a super axis and in that respect it's
        similar to Matlab's plot and plotyy functions but as you will learn it is much more than that.
        <br><br>
        It may be confusing at first that plt is both the name of a pseudo object as well
        as the name of the whole toolbox. In fact all the pseudo objects described here are
        created, modified, and queried by using calls to the same <span class="mcode">plt()</span>
        function. The plt pseudo object differs from the remaining pseudo objects in that:
        <ul>
          <li>For the remaining pseudo objects, the first plt argument will always be the name of
              the pseudo object (as a string) but this is not true for the plt pseudo object.
              To create a plt pseudo object, one or more numeric arrays are always required to specify
              the points to be plotted and usually we put these arrays at the beginning of
              the argument list which makes it more obvious that we are creating a plt pseudo object.
              It is not strictly necessary to put the numeric arrays first and a call to plt will
              still create a plt pseudo object when the first argument is a string, as long as that
              string is not one of the following 21 strings (not case sensitive):

          <li>When a plt pseudo object is created, two other pseudo objects are automatically
                created as well (namely <span class="mcode2">cursor</span> and <span class="mcode2">grid</span>)
          <li>A new figure window is immediately created to contain the plt pseudo object.
          <li>The plt pseudo object may be called from the command line (similar to Matlab's
              <span class="mcode">plot</span> command) whereas it only makes sense to use
              the other pseudo objects inside a <span class="mcode">.m</span> file.
          <li>Nearly every other section of this help file is dedicated to describing the details of the plt pseudo object.

    <td>The cursor pseudo object, more than any of the others is what gives the plt toolbox such
        an advantage for GUIs involving plotting and data exploration. Once you get used
        to the smooth and natural methods provided for cursoring, zooming and panning you will wonder
        how you lived without them and you will want all your GUI tools to be similarly equipped.
        <br><br>
        The description of the cursor pseudo object is long to fit comfortably in this table, so a
        separate section of the help file (which you will find <a href="Cursor%20commands.htm">here</a>)
        is dedicated for that purpose. That section describes how to query and modify the cursor objects
        as well as how to create a cursor object using the <span class="mcode">'init'</span> action.
        (It's not likely worth your time to review the 'init' action details because normally you will
        let the plt pseudo object create the cursor object for you.)

    <td>The trace color of the native Matlab axis grid 
    lines can't be independently set leading to grid lines that overpower the 
    display. The grid line pseudo object is designed to solve this problem by 
    providing grid lines of whatever color and style you choose.
    Actually the grid line problem I referred to is mostly solved in the later Matlab
    releases (R2014b and newer), however you can't use that capability if you need to remain
    compatible with older Matlab versions. plt doesn't have this problem and the grid
    lines will look wonderful on all supported Matlab versions (ver 6.1 thru R2019a).
    <br><br> 
    Grid lines are positioned at each tick label. Additional (sub-decade) grid lines will also
    be used for logarithmically scaled axes that span six or fewer decades. (The
    six decade limit may be changed by adjusting the <span class="mcode">logTR</span>
    figure application data property which defaults to <span class="mcode">1.0e6</span>)
    <br><br>
    <b>The grid line functions are:</b>
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'init',color,erMode,LineStyle,In7,In8,In9,In10)</span><br>
    &emsp; - Initializes grid lines on axis
            <span class="mcode">ax</span> of color <span class="mcode">color</span>
            with erase mode <span class="mcode">erMode</span>
            and LineStyle <span class="mcode">LineStyle</span>.<br>
    &emsp; - <span class="mcode">color</span> is optional with default [.13 .13 .13]<br>
    &emsp; - <span class="mcode">erMode</span> is optional with default 'xor'.<br>
    &emsp; - <span class="mcode">LineStyle</span> is optional with default '-'<br>
    &emsp; - <span class="mcode">In7,In8</span> is an optional parameter/value pair to apply to the grid lines<br>
    &emsp; - <span class="mcode">In9,In10</span> is an optional parameter/value pair to apply to the grid lines<br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <i>The pltvbar.m demo program uses this call to create a tabular<br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; list next to the main plot area. Although that demo as well as the<br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; three line example below calls this 'init' action, you will rarely<br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; if ever do this because the grid pseudo object created automatically<br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; by the plt pseudo object is usually sufficient.</i>
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'toggle')&nbsp; </span>- toggle grids (on/off)
    <br><br>    
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'get')  &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- get grid line handle
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'off') &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- turn grids off
    <br><br>    
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'on') &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- turn grids on
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax,'update') &nbsp;</span>- update grids
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid',ax) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- same as above
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('grid') &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>-
             equivalent to <span class="mcode">plt('grid',gca)</span>
    <br><br>
    All the above calls return the grid line handle. Setting <span class="mcode">ax</span> to zero
    in any of these commands is equivalent to specifying gca.<br>
    To experiment with these functions, try typing this at the command prompt:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; plt('grid',axes,'init',[.7 1 1]); </span>% create axis & grid pseudo object<br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; set(gca,'ylim',[0 6]); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>% change axis limits<br>
    <span class="mcode">&gt;&gt; plt('grid'); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>% update grid lines
